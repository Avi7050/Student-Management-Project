The Student Management System is a Java-based web application employing the Spring framework, MySQL database, and Spring Security for educational institutions. It streamlines student-related tasks with CRUD operations, allowing administrators to manage student profiles and courses efficiently. This includes creating, updating, and deleting student records and associating them with specific courses. Spring Security ensures secure access control with role-based authentication, encrypted passwords, and session management.
